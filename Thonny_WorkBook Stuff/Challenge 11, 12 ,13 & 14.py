#Challenge 11 , 12 , 13 & 14

#Challenge 11 - Multiplication
#This code asks for how much you spend
food =float(input("How much do you spend on lunchtime food in an average day? "))
food = food*5
#Then it would print out how much you would spend in a print line
print("This means that in a week you will spend",food)

#Challenge 12 - Dividing
#This code would ask for how much people to share 1000$ with in your household and then it would split the cash into that amount of groups
shares = int(input("How many people do you want to share the money with? "))
money = 1000/shares
#It would then print out how muhc to each person.
print(money," to each person")

#Challenge 13 - Modulus %
#This code would show the remainder of division
print(7%2)

#Challenge 14 - Additions
#This would replace the first varieble with the next one because they both have the same name
length =10
#This would then add 20 to the original amount
length = length+20
length += 20
print(length)
